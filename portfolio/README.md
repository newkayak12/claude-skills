**English** · [한국어](KOR.md)

Skills for the whole arc of a job application: reading what a job posting actually wants, deciding
where you are competitive, rewriting your materials so your real experience reads at the level it
was, and rehearsing until you can defend it out loud. The skills are deliberately narrow and
non-overlapping — scoring a portfolio, diagnosing its writing patterns, rewriting a sentence, and
matching it to a JD are four different jobs, and each one names the others it is not.

Everything is calibrated for the Korean job market — company-type profiles, ATS rules, and culture
signals live in `references/ats-rules-korea.md` and
`references/korea-company-culture-signals.md`. Analysis output is written in Korean by default.

Several skills use `think-tool` and `mcp-reasoner` as required checkpoints for their
highest-stakes judgments (severity classification, pass/screen-out calls, ownership
classification). Connect them under Claude settings → MCP Servers as remote SSE endpoints.

## Install & Uninstall

```bash
/plugin install portfolio@newkayak12-claude-skills
/plugin uninstall portfolio@newkayak12-claude-skills
```

> **trophy rides along.** From this version, the first interactive session after you install or update this plugin installs [trophy](../trophy/README.md) (achievements) once, in user scope, if you don't have it. Nothing is sent until you say yes; uninstalling trophy is respected (it is never reinstalled). To opt out beforehand: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/plugins/.newkayak12-trophy-ride.done`. Needs `sh` (Windows without one is not covered).

## Skills

### `job-application-workflow`

The entry point. Six steps for one specific role: fit → review → tailoring → 자기소개서 →
interview plan → mock interview. Use it when you have a target company and posting in hand.
Skip it for open-ended "what should I do with my career" questions, or when you have already
passed interviews and are negotiating an offer.

```
Coupang backend engineer posting, applying next week. JD is pasted below —
run the whole process with me from fit through a mock interview.
```

```
[1] fit                       서류 통과 가능성, gaps by severity, apply or not
      ↓
[2] feedback        interviewer-grade verdict on the materials
      ↓
[3] rewrite         Before/After, tailored to the JD
      ↓
[4] write:writer-verification 자기소개서 drafts from your material only
      ↓
[5] interview-plan            study plan, STAR prompts you fill
      ↓
[6] mock-interview            live interview with coaching
```

Each step has a skip condition and a standalone-input fallback. The 자기소개서 step needs the
`write` plugin and does not count characters — check each 문항's limit yourself. Nothing is
researched about the company: fit reasons only from what you give it. Every step carries the
`[확정]` list forward and marks missing facts `[확인 필요]`.

### `fit`

One skill for "does my portfolio fit", with or without a posting. **With a JD**, it parses the JD
and the portfolio independently, then judges must-haves line by line (both sides quoted; a
technology only in a Skills list is a gap), classifies gaps 치명적 / 보완 가능 / 마이너, and opens
with 서류 통과 / 경계 / 스크린아웃 plus the one factor that would most shift it. **Without a JD**,
it characterizes what engineer the portfolio signals and scores it against Korean company types
(대형 플랫폼, 성장기 스타트업, 핀테크/엔터프라이즈, 글로벌 테크, 개발도구/OSS) — Top 2 fits and the
type to avoid, each with evidence, mismatch and one fix. Company signals come only from what you
give; a missing fact stays `[확인 필요]`. Checked against the two skills it replaced on the same
resume and JD (`evals/`, `_repo/docs/plans/portfolio-consolidate/fit-comparison.md`).

```

```

### `feedback`

Reads your portfolio as an interviewer who has seen a hundred this week — pattern-matching on
what's *missing*, not just what's present. You pick one of four reviewer personas (Staff Engineer /
Startup EM / Enterprise Tech Lead / OSS-DevTools Lead) and it stays in that persona throughout.
Scores five dimensions, then challenges every score of 7 or above with the objection a skeptical
interviewer would raise; only scores that survive stay high. Not for rewriting sentences
(`rewrite`) or JD matching (`fit`).

```
Review my portfolio as a staff engineer at a large platform company.
Be harsh — I'd rather hear it now than in the interview.
```

Five dimensions: Technical Depth · System Design · Impact and Results · Leadership/Ownership ·
Portfolio Narrative. Score is the highest level *fully* satisfied — partial evidence does not round
up. Output includes the single core vulnerability, the top five questions this persona will ask,
and three prioritized fixes. Rubric and persona details: `references/scoring-rubric.md`,
`references/personas.md`.

```
[차원별 점수]
Technical Depth: 6 / 10
근거: Kafka 도입은 서술되어 있으나 대안 검토와 트레이드오프가 없음
🧠 Devil's advocate: 규모 수치는 인상적이나 본인 기여 범위가 불명확 — 7 → 6
```

Beyond the interviewer's read, it answers whether the document gets read at all. A quantified
document-convention check (`references/resume-conventions.md` — summary block, bullet budget, XYZ+S
shape, section order, and the ownership rule that differs by language), tallied rather than listed
and capped at the five highest screen-cost violations (`XYZ+S n/m · 의사결정 동사 n%`); an
ATS/parser-safety pass (evidence trapped in tables or images, non-standard section headers, contact
in the PDF header — the document is parsed before it is read); an `[AI 스크리너 요약 / AI Screener
Summary]` — the 3-line summary a screening model would actually generate, plus what of the
candidate's strongest evidence did not survive it; and a two-reader `[서류 스크린 판정 / Screen
Verdict]` grounded in screening research (`references/screen-models.md`): a recruiter 6-second pass
judged only on the F-pattern visible path (Ladders eye-tracking) and an engineer 30-second skim with
typo/tech-name checks (Lerner's calibration data), each 통과/경계/탈락 with the deciding factor —
plus a `[레드 플래그 / Red Flags]` block (경력 갭, 잦은 이직, 직함 인플레이션, 검증 불가 주장 비율 …)
where each flag carries a one-line interview defense; screeners read to reject, so flags are never
netted against strengths.

This screen layer was developed in a `-beta` lane and merged in after two head-to-head benchmarks
(a real 40-page portfolio and the impressive-surface fixture) returned identical dimension scores and
identical core-vulnerability findings on both sides, while the screen pass added real catches the
substance-only review structurally cannot make — an unexplained 8-month gap, a metric that meant two
different things in two documents, a resume with no contact details at all.

Hand it a previous version too and it switches to **revision mode** (`references/revision-diff.md`):
the review opens with a before/after tally table and whether the screen verdict moved, regressions
get their own lines — including claims the rewrite *introduced*, like a summary that now says 설계
over bullets that still say 개발 — and time-windowed claims ("12개월 무사고") are checked against
today's date. Promoted from the beta lane after a v1/v2 head-to-head where the structured diff caught
two regressions the ad hoc comparison missed. Tally denominators are pinned in the same file so two
versions are always counted the same way.

Three more passes, from `references/claim-and-consistency.md`, ask whether the document agrees with
itself: a **consistency cross-check** (dates across sections against the summary's tenure, every
Skills entry against the bullets that would evidence it — `스킬 근거율 n/m` with the unevidenced
entries named, role claims against bullet verbs), a **claim audit** (every outcome bullet checked
for 수치·베이스라인·기간·기여 범위 — `완전 주장 n/m`, worst three named with the exact interview
question each invites; the tally caps the Impact score, it never sets it), and **level
calibration** — the level the document claims (연차, 직함, target role) against the level it reads
at on a four-rung evidence ladder (주니어 / 미드 / 시니어 / 리드), `레벨 갭 ±n` with the two bullets
that set the ceiling. Over-claim is the 직함 인플레이션 flag with a number on it; under-claim is
Improvement Priority #1.

```
7년차 시니어라고 썼는데 이 문서가 진짜 시니어로 읽히는지 봐줘
```

```
레벨 갭: 주장 시니어 / 읽힘 미드 (−1) — 천장: "주문 조회 API 1.2s → 380ms", "중복 차감 주 12건 → 0건"
XYZ+S 0/8 · 완전 주장 2/3 · 스킬 근거율 5/6 · 날짜 불일치 0 · 레벨 갭 −1 · 의사결정 동사 0% · 불릿/롤 max 5
```

Every review ends with that one tally line, and the candidate can re-count it against their own
document: bullets are listed before they are counted, denominators are pinned, each finding is
stated once, and thresholds are labelled provisional (§D, §F). These passes were promoted from the
`-beta` lane after three benchmarks — the first two showed findings parity with one extra finding
(`레벨 갭`) but miscounted tallies; the third, after the counting rules were pinned, matched the
hand-computed ground truth on every tally across both fixtures.

A real-session run on a 36-slide deck showed what all that evidence costs when it comes first: the
verdict was the ninth block, resume denominators (`XYZ+S 9/60`, `불릿/롤 21`, a 6-second F-pattern
call) were applied to slides, 58% fired a red flag against a ~60% threshold, and one finding appeared
four times. Since 1.14.0 the review is **judgment first**: 총평 (three sentences, the recruiter and
engineer verdicts inside it), 차원별 점수, 핵심 취약점, 개선 우선순위 — then an **appendix** where
every finding carries an ID (`R1` `C2` `A3` `L1` `F1`) and the body refers to it instead of
restating it. Format is detected up front (§0 of `claim-and-consistency.md`): on a deck the XYZ+S
denominator is outcome-claim bullets only, `불릿/롤` is `—`, and the recruiter pass reads the first
three slides. Boundary values print as `경계 (58%, 기준 ~60%)` and never fire a flag on their own.
Three rules came from the same session about how the skill behaves *after* the review: a missing
fact is left as `[확인 필요: ○○]` — no back-calculated or "plausible" number is ever written; a
decision the candidate has settled goes on a `[확정]` list and is not reopened; and when the
candidate writes their own sentence, only typos, misused terms, and cross-document contradictions
are checked — the reviewer posture does not follow into their writing.

**Beta lane — `feedback-beta`.** feedback plus pattern's four measures in one pass: `피동 n` and `팀 주어 n` join the tally, number density is reported over 완전 주장's denominator as a reading (never a second penalty), and decision visibility is an appendix note. Triggers only on an explicit beta request; the stable `feedback` and `pattern` are unchanged. Promotion is decided after comparison runs (`evals/`).

### `pattern`

Not what your portfolio says but how it reads. Audits six dimensions: decision-verb ratio
(제안/채택/배제 vs. bare 개발했습니다), agency language, number density, failure-narrative presence, decision visibility,
and verb energy. Use it when you've been told your portfolio "lacks ownership" but nobody could
point at where. Not for rewriting the flagged sentences (`rewrite`) or overall scoring
(`feedback`).

```
People keep saying my portfolio doesn't show ownership. Analyze the writing patterns
and show me the actual sentences causing that impression.
```

Thresholds it applies: fewer than ~20 % of action sentences carrying a decision verb is worth
calling out in a senior portfolio (the `저는/제가` rate is deliberately *not* measured — subject
omission is normal Korean); a number-free impact-claim rate above 60 % for 5+ years of
experience is a problem. Complete absence of failure or difficulty is itself a signal.

### `rewrite`

Takes specific passages and produces Before / After with a 2–4 sentence explanation of what changed
and why it lands differently with an interviewer. It diagnoses the actual weakness first — missing
numbers, passive ownership, no context, no tradeoff, no outcome — and writes the rewrite with
`[확인 필요: ○○]` where a fact is missing instead of inventing one. **Give it a JD** and it
tailors the resume to that posting: required skills and responsibility verbs from the JD, a
Missing / Weak / Strong gap table, rewritten text per section, and a list of what NOT to change —
achievement numbers, scope and dates are never altered. Output is in the same language as the
input. Checked against the resume-tailorer it absorbed on the same resume and JD (`evals/`).

**No numbers to put in?** It asks, it never guesses: metric types for your role (money, time, %,
volume, quality, frequency), scale / impact / before-after questions, and where the data might live
(dashboards, tickets, PR counts, release notes). It never proposes a value. A figure you give
yourself is kept as written and tagged `(본인 추정)`; without a baseline `feedback` still treats it as
incomplete. No data at all: the marker stays, or the line is dropped or merged
(`skills/rewrite/references/metric-discovery.md`).

```
"모니터링 시스템을 구축했습니다" — rewrite this and the three bullets under it
so they read at senior level.
```

| Principle | Weak | Strong |
|---|---|---|
| Specificity | 성능 개선 | [확인 필요: 지표] [확인 필요: 전 → 후] 개선 — 원인·방법 한 줄 |
| Ownership | 팀에서 진행했습니다 | 제가 설계하고 주도했습니다 (본인 역할이 맞을 때) |
| Decision, not action | Kafka로 비동기 처리 구현 | Kafka를 택한 이유 — [확인 필요: 비교한 대안과 기준] |
| Outcome, not activity | 모니터링 구축 | 장애 감지 시간 [확인 필요: 전 → 후] |

ATS keyword rules and per-company-type culture signals: `references/ats-rules-korea.md`,
`references/korea-company-culture-signals.md`; JD tailoring procedure:
`skills/rewrite/references/jd-tailoring.md`.

### `interview-plan`

Planning, not practice. Gathers your background, target, timeline and biggest worry; calibrates to
company type (FAANG, Korean Tier-1, growth startup, enterprise — each tests materially
differently); identifies gaps across coding, system design, and behavioral; then produces a
week-by-week plan where every week has a measurable milestone, plus 6–8 STAR prompts you answer from your own experience.
Without an interview date it marks `[확인 필요: 면접 날짜]` and invents no week count; it runs gap analysis before
planning — skipping that is the most common failure.

```
Kakao backend interview in 8 weeks. Six years Spring/JVM, weak on distributed
system design, strong on coding. Build me a prep plan.
```

Final-week rule: no new material. Two full mocks, STAR stories rehearsed aloud, three hardest
problems re-attempted, logistics settled. Topic sequencing and practice volume per domain:
`references/study-domains.md`.

### `mock-interview`

A live mock interview grounded in your actual portfolio, in one of four personas — picked from the role or company you name, and the first question comes in the same turn. Question types:
anchored (straight from your portfolio), gap probes (what's vague — "팀 전체가 한 건지 본인이
주도한 건지"), depth drills (one level below what you wrote), failure/recovery, and hypothetical
extension. One question at a time, no preview of the list, and it pushes back once on evasive
answers. A coaching note follows each answer; the interview itself stays realistic rather than
therapeutic. Not for building a study plan (`interview-plan`).

```
Mock interview me as an enterprise fintech tech lead, based on this portfolio.
Don't go easy on the reliability questions.
```

Closes with an overall verdict (would this persona advance you), your strongest and weakest
answers, and the one thing to work on before the real interview.

### `deck-builder`

Treats a deck as a build rather than a document. `template.pptx` is the toolchain — its slides are
the archetype catalog; `deck.mdx` is the source, the only file anyone edits; the output pptx is a
build artifact, regenerated in full each time. Every output slide is a clone of a template slide
with its content swapped, so the template's design survives byte for byte and nothing is laid out
from scratch. Art can be source too: a picture slot accepts an `.svg`, which is rasterized at build time to
a PNG sized for its frame and cached by content hash in `.deckcache/`. The pptx itself only ever
carries raster images — SVG does not render the same in PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides and a
PDF export, and older PowerPoint shows nothing for it, so the vector stays in the source tree and
the build asserts that nothing vector reached the package. That closes the gap where
everything in a deck is text a model can write except the one diagram someone still has to draw.
Pictures carry a fit mode — `| fit` keeps the whole image by shrinking the frame to its shape,
the default `| fill` crops to the frame, and `| fill top` chooses what survives. `| transparent` knocks a PNG's background out by flooding inward from the edges — white inside a
diagram survives, only the background touching the outside goes — so a screenshot stops reading as
a pasted box on a dark slide. Visibility decides rather than tidiness: if what survives would
average close to the slide's own background, `check` says so instead of handing back an invisible
image. `check` reports
how much any crop discards, the image's effective dpi against its frame, whether generated art
strayed off the template's palette, and whether an image's border will read as a pasted box on
that slide's background. A picture losing half of itself is treated as the same defect as a table
row falling off the slide: the engine does not lose content quietly.

Where the template lays type over a picture — a full-bleed backdrop with a title on it — neither
the image nor the text is wrong on its own and the slide is still unreadable, so `check` decodes
the pixels that actually land behind each text box (following the crop, the fit mode and any
knockout) and scores them against that text's own color: WCAG 3:1 for large type, 4.5:1 for body.
More than a fifth of the area below the line and it says so, with the average color behind the
words. A picture drawn *after* the text it covers is an error rather than a warning — the words
end up behind the image. The render suite checks the prediction against the page: on a pale sky
backdrop `check` reports `#D2E1F8` behind the title, and that is the color pdftoppm paints there.

Overrun is measured the same way. Where text takes more lines than the template's own does,
`check` says how far below the design it now sits and what it runs into — an error when that
reaches another shape. It reports only what clears the estimate's own error bar: predicting
wrapping from an em model is worth about a line, and a designed frame often has less slack
than that, so the margins belong to `render`. Calibrating against the template rather than
the frame took a 46% false-positive rate on the designer's own slides down to zero.

Underfill counts as a defect too. A frame drawn for four paragraphs holding one leaves a
hole exactly where the rest would have been, and nothing used to say so — `check` only ever
looked at too much. It now reports a slot holding less than about half the template's own
volume, with the percentage, because frames never move and the gap is the author's to close.

Capacity is measured in em rather than characters, because counting characters makes a Hangul
line look 1.8x shorter than it is and lets an overflowing title through. The template
calibrates it: most slots hold text that already wraps by design, so an absolute width is
noise — what `check` reports is a slot the template keeps to one line dropping onto a second,
or content far longer than the template's own. And `render` names the typefaces the renderer
does not have before showing the preview, because a substituted font rewraps every line and
turns the preview into a story about the substitute.

`catalog` prints the template's palette and its type — theme slots, the colors the slides actually
use, the theme fonts, and the pt sizes in play — plus each picture frame's exact size in points. Author
an SVG at that pt size and `font-size="16"` in the art is the same 16pt as the body text beside it, so
generated art is written in the reference's colors rather than colors that merely look close: the
reference supplies the design, the generated source supplies only the content. SVG assets are the
one thing that needs the renderer at *build* time; PNG and JPEG need nothing.

A reference template is mandatory — there is no built-in deck design and no fallback, so without
a `.pptx` the engine exits with an error rather than inventing slides. The source file is
`deck.mdx`, not `deck.md`: it is compiled, not read, and any other extension is rejected.
Requires Python 3.9+ (stdlib only — no python-pptx, no PyYAML).

```
이 템플릿 읽고 분기 리뷰 내용으로 PPT 만들어줘.
슬라이드별로 어떤 아키타입 쓸지 먼저 보여주고.
```

```bash
# 1 — catalog: every archetype, its slots, and what the template shows there
python3 /abs/path/to/skills/deck-builder/scripts/deck.py catalog \
  --template "template.pptx" --output "deck.catalog.md"

# 2 — check: unknown slots, missing images, text that will overflow its frame
python3 /abs/path/to/skills/deck-builder/scripts/deck.py check --deck deck.mdx

# 3 — build: the same deck.mdx always produces a byte-identical pptx
python3 /abs/path/to/skills/deck-builder/scripts/deck.py build --deck deck.mdx
```

`deck.mdx` also carries `notes:` for speaker notes on any slide, `**bold**` / `*italic*` / `` `code` ``
for inline emphasis that flips attributes on a copy of the template's own run rather than replacing its
type, and a `template_hash` from `catalog` that pins the deck to the template's structure. That last one
guards the failure this design would otherwise have: insert or reorder a template slide and `@s3` starts
meaning a different slide, which without the pin shows up as a strange-looking deck instead of an error.
Editing the template's wording does not move the hash — only structure does.

`deck.mdx` is markdown with a small, self-parsed syntax — `## @s3` starts a slide from template
slide 3, `key: value` fills a text slot, indented `- ` lines fill a list, indented `| a | b |`
lines fill table rows, a path fills a picture, `!drop` deletes a shape, and an omitted slot keeps
the template's own content. Lists and table rows grow and shrink freely: four bullets go into a
three-bullet archetype by cloning the paragraph that carries the formatting. Replaced images are
center-cropped to the frame's aspect ratio rather than stretched.

Known limits, reported explicitly rather than hidden:

| Limit | Detail |
|---|---|
| **A template is mandatory** | Without a reference `.pptx` the engine exits with an error and produces nothing. |
| **No new layouts** | Output slides are clones of template slides. Content with no matching archetype needs the template extended in PowerPoint first. |
| **Charts are not writable** | Series values live in an embedded xlsx plus cached XML. `catalog` lists chart slots; `build` leaves them at template values. |
| **SVG assets need a renderer at build time** | PNG/JPEG need nothing; an `.svg` must be rasterized. |
| **Layout truth needs a renderer** | `check` estimates from frame width ÷ font size; only `render` sees real collisions, and that needs LibreOffice. |
| **Capacity is an estimate** | Overflow warnings come from frame width ÷ font size, not real text metrics — a prompt to look, not a verdict. |
| **Formatting follows the template** | A replaced run inherits the template run's font, size and color; per-word emphasis is not expressible in `deck.mdx`. |
| **Nesting shows only if the template indents** | A nested item is written at outline level 1; a template that defines no level-1 indent renders it flush. |
| **Speaker notes are dropped** | Notes slides are not carried into the build. |

Two test suites, neither needing a fixture file in the repo:

```bash
# unit — package structure, parsing, slot writing. Builds its own minimal pptx.
python3 portfolio/skills/deck-builder/scripts/test_deck.py

# render round-trip — mdx -> pptx -> PDF, checked against all three. Needs a renderer:
# soffice on PATH, or DECK_RENDER_DOCKER=<image with soffice>. Skips cleanly without one.
python3 portfolio/skills/deck-builder/scripts/test_render.py
```

The render suite authors a designed five-archetype template (`fixture_template.py`), builds a
six-slide Korean deck from it, exports a PDF, and then checks that every value in the `.mdx`
reaches both the pptx and the PDF, that no template placeholder copy leaked through, that the
brand colors and decorative shapes survived, and that a picture wider than its frame was cropped
rather than stretched. `fixture_template.py` is a test fixture, never a fallback — the engine has
no built-in template and must not acquire one.

#### Recolor — `deck-builder` (was `ppt-keycolor-changer`)

Swaps key colors across an entire PPTX by scanning and replacing raw XML — which catches theme
tokens, gradient stops, chart series, table cells, hyperlinks, and `schemeClr` mappings that the
python-pptx API misses. Discovery always runs first, even when you already know the hex, because
the frequency scan proves the color is in the file and surfaces tonal variants. The mapping table
is confirmed with you before anything is written; output is a new file, never an overwrite.
Requires Python 3.9+ (stdlib only).

```
presentation.pptx의 오렌지 계열 색을 전부 토스 파란색으로 바꿔줘.
바꾸기 전에 어떤 색이 몇 번 쓰였는지 먼저 보여주고.
```

```bash
# Step 1 — discover: frequency table of every hex in the file
python /abs/path/to/skills/deck-builder/scripts/ppt_keycolor_changer.py discover \
  --input "deck.pptx"

# Step 5 — replace, after you confirm the mapping table
python /abs/path/to/skills/deck-builder/scripts/ppt_keycolor_changer.py replace \
  --input   "deck.pptx" \
  --mapping '{"E85E3A":"0064FF","FF8060":"4D96FF","FFB399":"99C2FF"}' \
  --exclude "336699" \
  --suffix  tossblue
```

Built-in presets (main / light / lighter / muted / dark): `toss-vivid`, `toss-soft`, `apple-blue`,
`material-indigo`, `kakao-yellow`, `naver-green`. Source tones are mapped to target tones by HSL
lightness rank so the visual hierarchy survives.

Always preserved unless you explicitly override: `#000000`, `#FFFFFF`, `#F9F9F9`, `#FEFEFE`,
`#FDFDFD`, any color with RGB max − min ≤ 20, and any hue more than 60° from the source. Output is
named `<original>_<suffix>.pptx` and auto-increments to `_v2`, `_v3` rather than overwriting.

Known limits, reported explicitly rather than hidden:

| Limit | Detail |
|---|---|
| Embedded images | PNG/JPEG/WMF/EMF pixels cannot be changed by XML substitution |
| External Excel charts | Series colors defined in a linked `.xlsx` are outside the PPTX |
| Encrypted PPTX | The ZIP cannot be opened — remove the password first |

Every report ends with the image caveat: colors inside inserted images need editing in an image
tool, not here.
