# graph

**English** · [한국어](KOR.md)

Graph engineering for the harness flow, mediated by a local MCP server. The main
session orchestrates; the graph engine owns state, routing, execution, and adjudication.

Sibling to `harness`, not a replacement. **harness** owns the six-stage reasoning
contract. **graph** owns who executes a node, and whether the result survives contact
with the worktree.

## Why

The static Workflow engine had to spawn a transport subagent per node just to drive a
vendor CLI through Bash. A subagent waiting on a long-running process can only poll, and
cache-read scales with turn count. Measured on one real run, same unit of work:

| shell turns in the node | cache-read tokens |
|---|---|
| 4 | 227,323 |
| 12 | 1,281,319 |
| 17 | 1,965,390 |

Across that run the transport layer cost more than the reasoning layer. An MCP call is
one turn and blocks, so a node **cannot** poll — the failure mode is removed structurally
rather than discouraged in a prompt.

## Install

Install the marketplace plugin and use `graph:install` to verify the connection:

```text
/plugin install graph@newkayak12-claude-skills
```

> **trophy rides along.** From this version, the first interactive session after you install or update this plugin installs [trophy](../trophy/README.md) (achievements) once, in user scope, if you don't have it. Nothing is sent until you say yes; uninstalling trophy is respected (it is never reinstalled). To opt out beforehand: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/plugins/.newkayak12-trophy-ride.done`. Needs `sh` (Windows without one is not covered).

For a source checkout, `graph:install` can instead merge this direct registration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "graph-engineering": { "command": "node", "args": ["<plugin root>/mcp/broker.mjs"] }
  }
}
```

Zero runtime dependencies, Node 18+.

Optional: `graph:install` can run `develop:like-my-code` to write `.claude/conventions/`; the broker then tells every plan, setgoal, implement, and test node, on any vendor, to read and follow the relevant files.

## Status
- v1.9.1 — trophy rides along: the first interactive session after this update installs trophy once if missing (uninstall respected)

- **v1.9.0 — Mod: `/graph-live` pane** (Claude Code 2.1.292+, early access, interactive sessions): a read-only view of this folder's newest graph run in the teams 0.46.0 style. Tabs Flow / Nodes (keys `1`-`2`), a stage rail, the Next / Now / Blocked line, one row per subgoal (impl → test → gate) and a gates bar; Nodes is a To do / Doing / Done board. The mod only reads the run files; files over 4 MiB are skipped. No band of its own: graph runs already show in the harness pipeline band. English by default, Korean with Claude Code's `language`. Mod tests 20; real Claude Code captures EN/KO.
- **v1.8.2 — the lock wait deadline is monotonic**: `acquireLock` set its deadline from
  `Date.now()`, so a forward wall-clock jump (wake from sleep, an NTP step) made a waiter
  throw `LockTimeoutError` at once instead of waiting out its timeout. The deadline now uses
  `performance.now()`; stale-lock mtime checks stay on the wall clock. The default timeout is
  unchanged, nothing imported from teams. Tests: graph suite 146 (from 145).
- **v1.8.1 — own-pid claim reclaim and a boot-id test**: `ownerGone` judged a claim by its
  owner's pid and boot, so a `running` claim stamped under the broker's own pid was never
  reclaimed, even when this process no longer held its ticket. `activeNodes` now maps each
  held node to its ticket, and an own-pid claim with a matching boot is reclaimed (`abandoned`) only when this
  process does not hold that ticket; a held claim is never reclaimed. The existing boot-id
  branch (a claim from another boot is reclaimed though its pid is alive) gets its first repo
  test, with a live-pid control that stays `running` and a skip where
  `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id` is absent; deleting the boot comparison makes the test
  fail. No default changed, nothing imported from teams. Tests: graph suite 145 (from 143).
- **v1.8.0 — graph owns a transactional run store**: the run file was written in place
  (`writeFileSync`), so a reader could see half a file, and a lock that timed out let the
  write go ahead unlocked. New `mcp/store.mjs` (graph's own; nothing imported from teams):
  `mutateRun` takes the lock, reads the run fresh, runs `fn`, and writes to a temp file then
  renames, all under one lock. A lock timeout (`GRAPH_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS`, 5000) throws
  `LockTimeoutError`; a live owner's lock is never taken; a dead owner's lock is broken only
  under a separate `<lock>.steal` lock. Every broker write goes through it, and
  `open-nodes.json` is written the same way. **Claim before run**: `graph_run` claims the node
  with a ticket before it starts the adapter, so a second call on the same node is refused
  instead of running the vendor twice; a result or interruption whose ticket no longer holds
  is recorded `result_superseded`, not applied; retrying a subgoal or spec also retires its
  `running` nodes. **Ported from teams** (each re-checked as a defect here, each with a test
  that failed before): #1 a retry after a spec retry no longer waits on the dead generation;
  #2 `report` waits on live nodes; #6 `changed_files` claims with spaces, non-ASCII, notes,
  globs or renames match git; #7 a claimed file that exists but is git-ignored is not
  contradicted; #8 the torn read above; #9 an author `stage_ok:false` with no reason and
  passing checks goes on to be judged; #10 a rejection with no reason gets one from its
  checks/evidence; #11 malformed vendor JSON gets one fresh attempt. **Not ported**: #3
  (finished ≠ delivered) only adds a `settled` field to `runState`'s return, and graph already
  shows a settled failure in its node states (`unreachable`) and the report, so it adds
  nothing graph lacks; #4 (test goes to the non-implementing vendor) and #5 (author runs last
  under either allocation) are routing policy, and graph routes by the explicit or ordered
  allocation its user set. Also not ported, as features or policy rather than defects:
  daemon/taskmanager-only fixes (e332ed4 dispatchSettled/fold_deferred, 2917e2e, 5cbfb19,
  1d4bb37); 0a34817 (graph has no autoReassign, and spec problems already reach
  `graph_retry`); c182b99/453ff06 (graph has no goal threshold; the rest is cards and pins);
  1fccf7f (graph has no draft/review stages); 4983843, fd78c4a, e8086b7, dd610ef, 8406e45,
  fe1ed28, ff1e8df m1/m2/m4/m5/m8/m10/m12 and f0ee114 (teams features); 9d359b0
  capacityNotice/`routing_blocked_capacity` (manager parking); 094de8c (a cost policy that
  changes the gate contract); edd29fc (`requireRunnable` already refuses duplicates);
  ecd8c81/32f05eb (`--verify` Bash, a feature). **Race and crash repairs**: the steal is
  race-free: `<lock>.steal` is a `link()`ed file carrying its owner, a dead holder is
  succeeded through `<lock>.steal.<key>` and never removed by name, so one `link()` wins
  (same scheme as teams, graph's own code). A throw after the claim (prompt write, adapter,
  outcome) releases the claim: the node goes back to `pending` with its pre-claim fields,
  ledger `claim_failed`. A claim records the owner's pid and boot id, and a `running` node is
  reclaimed only when that process is dead or the claim came from another boot; elapsed time
  is used only for old run files with no owner, so a live adapter run longer than 10 minutes
  keeps its node and its result applies. Tests: new test-store (24) and test-ports (13),
  graph suite 143.
- **v1.7.2 — skill doc format**: the skills now carry the standard `## What Claude Does /
  What You Do` table. Documentation only; no broker change.
- **v1.7.1 — three fixes the teams bench found in the shared engine**: teams' first
  end-to-end rounds (`teams/scripts/bench/`) drove this engine's code through real
  sessions and hit three defects the unit suite never had; both stable bench runs reproduced
  the first. (1) A driving session that reports itself as `claude-opus-5[1m]` — a context
  variant the fresh-agent picker does not list — blocked at `plan` with `native host cannot
  select model`; the host's own model is now selectable by definition. (2) The execution
  default names a tier (`sonnet`) and hosts declare ids (`claude-sonnet-5`); the check compared
  strings, so every `implement` node could be `vendor-failure` with zero failed nodes, and the
  only way out was a second `graph_open`. Tiers now resolve against the declared list, and an
  undeclared tier runs on the host model with the substitution written into the routing
  reason. (3) A `gate:goal` that rejected the assembled result was never re-judged after the
  subgoal it blamed was retried — the run wedged with the fix in place; a subgoal retry now
  opens `gate:goal:N` over the live gates and moves `report` behind it, and the retried
  subgoal's briefing carries the goal gate's reason and gaps (and a failed test's checks,
  which a retry used to lose). Tests ported with the fixes. Bench: one run of this version's
  predecessor on a 4-package request completed 9/9 at 6× the cost and time of a plain
  session; teams' manager on the same request is a different topology (four runs plus a
  manager) and is read separately there.
- **v1.7.0 — typed edges and settled failure**: a dependency meant one thing, "must have
  succeeded". So `report` hung behind `gate:goal`, and a subgoal that ran out of retries left
  the run `blocked` forever - the subgoals that HAD passed were never reported. Edges now come
  in two kinds: `deps` is a data dependency (the dep must be `done`) and `after` is order-only,
  Make's `|` prerequisite (the dep must have finished, not passed). `report` hangs off the goal
  gate with `after`. When `graph_retry` finds the budget gone it settles the failure instead of
  returning a dead end: every node that needed the dead node's output through a data edge
  becomes `unreachable`, transitively and with the reason; a node that had already failed
  downstream is final too; order-only edges do not propagate. The goal gate goes `unreachable`,
  `report` becomes ready, and the run ends `complete` with the partial account written by the
  report node. A plain `failed` with retries left settles nothing - the report cannot run ahead
  of a retry. A spec may give a subgoal `after: [id]`, checked for self/dangling/cycle like
  `deps`. `graph_retry` returns `unreachable[]` and the next ready nodes when it declines;
  `graph_status` shows `after` and counts `unreachable`. Also fixed: a report rebuilt after a
  spec retry (`report:2`) was briefed without the whole run, and a critique's `blocking` /
  `problems` never reached the goal gate or the report.
- **v1.6.3 — Korean README**: documentation only. No skill or broker changes.
- **v1.6.2 — the run shows itself**: 1.6.1 had the driver print progress as plain text lines.
  A host with a live progress surface already has a better one, and a graph run is exactly the
  shape it wants: the skill now mirrors the node graph into the host's task list — a task per
  ready node, `in_progress` on dispatch, `completed` on the verdict — with the text lines kept
  as the fallback for hosts without one. Same small vocabulary either way (`node_id`,
  vendor/model, state, short `reason`), and the same rule holds: a line you cannot write from
  the verdict is a line you do not write.
- **v1.6.1 — orchestrate reports as it goes, and the report node has somewhere to land**:
  1.6.0 routed `report` to the peer vendor but left the driver's output template narrating
  the run, so a graph node's payload had nowhere to go and a driver under context pressure
  would quietly re-narrate. The template now ends with a `### Report` section relaying that
  node verbatim, and the mandates say plainly that the report node writes the run's account.
  The loop also prints one line per node as it goes — `node_id`, vendor/model, state, short
  reason — so a long run is visible while it runs; the line is written from the verdict the
  driver already holds, never from an opened payload. Duplication that had regrown against
  `references/` is gone again. QA: Usefulness/Authoring/Output-Quality PASS, MCP NONE,
  Weight OK; eval delta **+0.42** (12/12 vs 7/12), above the +0.375 baseline, re-measured
  after the edits with no regression. The driver is also told plainly that the broker does
  not serialize concurrent `implement` nodes — `readyNodes` returns every dependency-satisfied
  node, so keeping two of them off one worktree is the caller's job.
- **v1.6.0 — the peer writes the report, and progress is answerable**: `report` routes to
  the vendor that did *not* drive the run, so a run's account of itself is not written by
  its own driver; it stays reasoning work (read-only sandbox, `host_model` if it falls back
  to the host). `graph_status` now takes no `run_id`: it lists every run in a directory with
  state, counts, the node running right now with its vendor and elapsed seconds, and the last
  node to finish — so a lead that lost the id, or a second operator looking in, can find the
  run without the transcript. A running node in the single-run view carries the same detail.
  First full cross-vendor E2E on 1.5.7 completed 8/8 with Codex implementing and testing
  under `danger-full-access` and `changed_files_verified: true`.
- **v1.5.7 — honest absolute paths, opt-in full access**: the worktree cross-check compared
  an executor's absolute `changed_files` claim against git's relative output and failed every
  truthful node that used the briefing's own paths. Claude gains `danger-full-access`
  (`--permission-mode bypassPermissions`) as a per-run opt-in, matching Codex; defaults are
  unchanged and still answer to the project's permission settings.
- **v1.5.6 — close the two gaps the eval measured**: the blocked mandate now forbids
  *offering* a way past a gate, not only taking one, and `isolated: true` requires an actual
  worktree rather than a user's stated wish for one.
- **v1.5.5 — orchestrate QA follow-ups**: the loop carries `cwd` so a restarted client can
  find the run, and the last duplication the weight check found is gone (briefing rules and
  the ranking sentence live in `references/` only).
- **v1.5.4 — orchestrate QA pass**: the skill states the self-node dispatch contract
  (fresh agent at the returned model, briefing path only, JSON relayed verbatim), fans out
  ready self nodes before blocking on vendor nodes, promotes the discriminating rules to
  Standing Mandates, drops prose duplicated in `references/`, and names its trigger phrases.
- **v1.5.3 — orchestrate skill split**: routing detail, handoff obligations, and capacity
  recovery move to `skills/orchestrate/references/`; the skill keeps the loop, the mandates,
  and the verdict contract (275 -> 186 lines).
- **v1.5.2 — atomic capacity reset**: a `graph_retry` that is going to be rejected no
  longer clears capacity exclusions first, and an ordinary probe failure is never
  laundered into a capacity exclusion.
- **v1.5.1 — probe-time capacity**: a readiness probe rejected for usage limits is
  classified as spent capacity instead of a broken vendor, recorded on the run, and
  cleared by `graph_retry({reset_capacity:true})` with no interrupted node to name.
- **v1.5.0 — automatic allocation and capacity recovery**: balanced routing keeps
  reasoning on the driving host and prefers the other vendor's efficient model for
  Implement/Test. Claude now has a fresh-session CLI adapter. Fable/Astra are excluded
  from inherited defaults; explicit model requests remain supported. Usage-limit
  interruptions retain checkpoints and partial files, then route to another available
  vendor. No new token, spending, or turn limits are imposed.
- **v1.4.0 — host-neutral orchestration contract**: fresh role contexts, shared
  task directories and persisted handoffs, task-scoped Implement/Test inputs, and
  SetGoal/QualityGate retries are now explicit skill requirements. When both AI
  executors are usable, route by task fit and observed cost rather than requester
  identity. This release changes instructions, not the broker: automatic balancing,
  a standalone Claude adapter, and hard token budgets remain unimplemented.
- **v1.3.0 — current-session execution**: `graph:orchestrate` defaults to the active
  Codex or Claude session for every stage, using its native tools and current model.
  External vendor routing remains optional; no Codex CLI or fixed model is required.
- **v1.2.0 — Claude/Codex mixed orchestration**: `graph:orchestrate` now keeps reasoning,
  gates, and reporting on the Claude session while requiring Codex for implement/test.
  The node's selected model is forwarded into both Codex readiness probes, with
  model-scoped probe caching, so a bad global default cannot reject a run that names a
  working model explicitly.
- **v1.1.1 — Codex preferred by `graph:orchestrate`**: ordinary skill-driven runs now
  open with `vendor: "auto", candidates: ["codex"]`, so the bundled adapter is actually
  used when its readiness probe passes and falls back visibly to `self` when unavailable.
  Direct callers that omit `candidates` retain the quiet `auto` behavior introduced in
  v1.0.1.
- **v1.1.0 — per-stage routing**: `graph_open` takes `model` (a run-level default) and
  `policy`, a per-stage override map keyed by stage name plus the optional `gate:goal` —
  each entry may set `vendor`, `candidates`, `sandbox`, `model`. This expresses the harness
  contract directly: reasoning on a strong model, execution on whatever can actually write
  on this host. `graph_next` reports the chosen `model` per ready node, and an explicit
  `graph_run({model})` still wins for one call. Verified by a reduced-scale codex E2E that
  reached `report` with artifacts checked independently of the run's own verdicts.
- **v1.0.1 — stable line. No vendor by default**: `vendor: "auto"` no longer enrols every
  registered vendor as a candidate; the candidate list is empty by default, so an unnamed run
  degrades to `self` through the existing path. The `codex` vendor, its adapter, and the
  readiness probe are unchanged and still route when named (`vendor: "codex"`) or listed in
  `candidates`.
- v1.0.0 — moved the existing graph-engineering MCP out of the temporary `broker`
  plugin name and split lifecycle from execution: `graph:install` connects/verifies it,
  while `graph:orchestrate` drives the graph. Engine code and on-disk run format remain
  the existing implementation.

## Tools

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `graph_open` | throw a raw request in; the broker builds the flow as a node graph on disk |
| `graph_next` | ask which nodes are ready, and how each is routed |
| `graph_run` | the routed vendor executes one node; **blocks**; returns a one-line verdict |
| `graph_submit` | record a node the orchestrator executed itself; same adjudication |
| `graph_retry` | open a fresh attempt, carrying rejection feedback — a subgoal, or the spec itself. Budget gone: settles the failure, returns `unreachable[]` and the now-ready `report` |
| `graph_status` | compact run state; omit `run_id` for every run in a directory and what is running right now; `full:true` only for one node at a time |

## The orchestrator never holds the payload

The goal-spec, subgoal acceptance, upstream handoffs, prior rejection feedback,
changed-file lists and evidence all stay in the graph on disk. Tools return
`{node_id, stage, vendor, state, stage_ok}` and a short reason. Two consequences:

- **`setgoal` expands the graph inside the broker.** The spec it produces never passes
  through the caller; the per-subgoal implement/test/gate nodes and their dependencies
  are derived from it server-side.
- **The broker composes every node prompt** from graph state. `graph_run` does not
  accept a prompt — passing one is impossible on purpose.

This is what makes a long loop possible. If node results accumulated in the
orchestrator's context, a graph with retries would exhaust it and the loop would die
before the work did.

## Graph

`plan -> setgoal -> critique`, then per subgoal `implement -> test -> gate` with
subgoal dependencies mapped onto gate nodes, then `gate:goal:1 -> report`.

Edges come in two kinds. `deps` is a **data dependency**: the node consumes what the dep
produced, so the dep must be `done`. `after` is **order-only** — Make's `|` prerequisite:
the node must not start before the dep has finished, but it does not need the dep to have
passed. `report` hangs off the goal gate with `after`, which is what lets it write the
account of a failure. A spec may give a subgoal `after: ["U1"]` alongside `deps`.

Failure becomes **settled** at exactly one point: when `graph_retry` finds the retry budget
gone. Until then a `failed` node is a retry waiting to happen and nothing downstream is
written off. Once settled, every node that needed the dead node through a data edge becomes
`unreachable`, transitively and with the reason (`unreachable: gate:U1:2 is unreachable`);
a downstream node that had already failed is final too; order-only edges do not propagate.
The goal gate goes `unreachable`, `report` becomes ready, and the run ends `complete` with a
report that names what shipped and what did not. Only a run with no report node at all —
setgoal never produced a spec — still ends `blocked`.

A rejected subgoal gets a **new attempt** rather than a re-run node: the failed attempt
stays in the graph as evidence, its still-pending nodes are retired as `skipped`, and
anything that waited on the old gate is rewired to the new one.

When **critique** rejects the spec, retrying one subgoal fixes nothing — the decomposition
itself is in question. `graph_retry` with no `subgoal_id` reopens `setgoal` and `critique`
with the critique's problems as feedback and retires the subgoal graph the rejected spec
produced; the rebuilt graph hangs off the live critique node.

A judging node can fail with `stage_ok: true`. There, `stage_ok` means "the judging
itself worked" and the verdict is `accept` / `verified` / `sound`. Reading only `stage_ok`
once let a rejected subgoal flow downstream as if it had passed, which made the gate
decorative. Both `graph_run` and
`graph_submit` refuse a node whose deps are unmet, that is already finished, or that
does not exist — the ordering is enforced, not advisory.

## Routing

`vendor: "auto"` (default) tries each candidate in order and falls back to `self`.
A bare direct call has no candidates. `graph:orchestrate` instead opens with
`vendor: "auto", allocation: "balanced", host_vendor, host_model, native_models`.
Reasoning prefers the driving AI/model; Implement/Test prefer the other vendor using
Claude `sonnet` or Codex `gpt-5.6-sol`. If only one vendor is available, it can fill both
roles with fresh contexts and selectable models. Fable/Astra are never inherited from
the driving session automatically; they require an explicit model request. Hosts must
declare their native model capabilities honestly. A Codex session uses native agents
instead of nested Codex CLI; external vendors pass readiness probes.

Balanced ranking considers stage preference, assigned/running work, completion counts,
and execution errors. It is a deterministic heuristic, not learned performance or cost
prediction. Explicit policies override it. No token/spending cap is added.
The lead passes scoped artifact paths and submits compact results; it does not perform
every role in its own conversation. Each task's Implement/Test/Gate shares the same
working directory and code snapshot. See `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md` for the routing,
artifact, and retry contract and the broker's current enforcement limits.
A **named** vendor does not fall back — the node returns `vendor-failure` with per-vendor
probe reasons. Name the vendor when the run must prove who did the work; silent
degradation is what lets a graph lie about it.

`vendor`, `model`, `candidates` and `sandbox` set the run-level default; `policy` overrides
them **per stage**, keyed by stage name (`plan`, `setgoal`, `critique`, `implement`, `test`,
`gate`, `report`) plus the optional `gate:goal`. A stage entry wins over the run-level
setting, a stage without one inherits it, and `graph_next` reports the chosen `model` per
ready node. This is how "reasoning on a strong model, execution wherever it can actually
write" is expressed without a second run. The selected model also reaches the readiness
probe, so the probe and the real node cannot accidentally test different Codex models.

Reasoning nodes (plan, setgoal, critique, gate, report) are routed to a read-only
sandbox: they are judged by their content, so there is no file claim to cross-check.

## Adjudication

The broker may **lower** `stage_ok`, never raise it. Claimed `changed_files` are
cross-checked against `git status`:

- `isolated: true` (caller asserts a private worktree) -> `changed_files_verified` is
  `true`/`false`.
- shared worktree -> `null` unless a claim is *contradicted*. "Could not attribute" is
  neither a pass nor a failure.
- no git -> `change_attribution: "no-git"`, verification `null`.

A claimed file the worktree does not show fails the node regardless of what the executor
reported — vendor or orchestrator alike.

## Vendors

A vendor is anything meeting the adapter CLI contract:

```
<cmd> --detect  --cwd DIR --sandbox MODE --output FILE
<cmd> --stage implement|test --cwd DIR --prompt-file F --events-output F
      --output F --sandbox MODE [--isolated] [--add-dir DIR] [--model M]
```

Execution stages require exit 0 **and** `stage_ok === true` in the report. `codex` and
`claude` ship built in (`adapters/codex-exec-adapter.mjs` and
`adapters/claude-exec-adapter.mjs`). Claude uses print mode without resume or session
persistence. It disables MCP inheritance to avoid re-entering the graph, retains project
permissions, and never bypasses permission checks. Its read-only profile exposes only
Read/Glob/Grep; workspace-write adds editing and Bash tools under existing permissions.
This tool profile is not an OS filesystem sandbox. Permission-denied work fails visibly.
CLI flags follow the [Claude CLI reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference).
Add more per project in
`.claude/broker-vendors.json`, or point `BROKER_VENDORS` at a registry file:

```json
{
  "myvendor": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/abs/path/to/adapter.mjs"],
    "sandboxes": ["workspace-write"],
    "default_sandbox": "workspace-write",
    "requires_binary": "myvendor-cli"
  }
}
```

Readiness is a **real write probe**, not a version check: some sandboxes start, accept
the run, write nothing, and exit 0. The probe creates a throwaway file and looks at the
filesystem itself.

## Capacity recovery

Balanced runs distinguish usage-limit errors from task failures, at execution time and at
readiness probe time alike - the probe searches the whole adapter report, since adapters bury
that message at different depths. A vendor rejected for spent capacity is recorded on the run
as such rather than as a broken vendor. A quota interruption
preserves a checkpoint, raw report/log paths, and the working tree, excludes the exhausted
vendor for that run, and makes the node ready for another available executor. The next
session inspects the checkpoint and current files before continuing under the same goal.
This resumes work from artifacts; vendor conversations are not interchangeable.

For native agents, submit `stage_ok:false, failure_kind:"quota"` and available evidence.
Call `graph_next` for fallback. When all candidates are exhausted the run reports blocked;
after capacity returns, use `graph_retry({run_id,cwd,reset_capacity:true})`, adding `node_id`
when a specific interrupted node should reopen.
Each external invocation has its own output directory. Persisted state survives an MCP
restart; supply the original `cwd` with `run_id` when reconnecting. No automatic worktree
rollback occurs, and partial work is never treated as verified completion.

## Ledger

Under each node's `cwd`:

- `.harness-run/broker/ledger.jsonl` — append-only history
- `.harness-run/broker/open-nodes.json` — snapshot a PreToolUse hook can read

The harness gate treats an open node within its window as engagement. The ledger is
evidence, not a dependency: a write failure never fails a node, and a missing, stale, or
corrupt ledger is simply not engagement.

## Mod (Claude Code live UI)

graph ships a small mod: a pane that shows the live run of the graph engine. It is early access and optional. The broker works without it. The mod is read-only: it never writes the run file.

**Version.** Modules load on Claude Code 2.1.292 and newer. The module API is early access and may change between releases. An older build skips the module and the broker, hooks and CLIs work unchanged. If a build says modules are not turned on for installed plugins, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1`.

| Where it runs | Mod |
|---|---|
| Interactive terminal | on |
| Desktop app, Code tab | on |
| `claude -p` and headless adapters | off (no UI surface) |
| Codex, or no plugin | not applicable, nothing is lost |

**Features**

- **`/graph-live`** opens the pane. Tabs are Flow and Nodes (keys `1`-`2`; the selected one is bright with a dot). Flow draws the stages as a rail (`● Plan ━━ ● SetGoal ━━ ● Critique ━━ ◉ Build ┄┄ ○ Goal gate ┄┄ ○ Report`), a Next, Now or Blocked line (what runs next, what runs now, or where the run is stuck), one line per subgoal with its impl, test and gate steps, a gates bar and the goal-gate `%`. Nodes lists every node with its state and attempt.
- **Where the data comes from.** The newest run file in `.harness-run/broker/runs/` under the session folder. graph writes a run file under the folder the run was started in, so only runs started in this folder show; a run started from another folder (another worktree included) does not. If none is live, the pane says there is no run.
- **Language.** English by default; Korean when Claude Code's `language` setting is Korean.

## Skills

- `install` — connect or verify the existing graph engine without copying it
- `orchestrate` — run the whole harness flow from the main session
