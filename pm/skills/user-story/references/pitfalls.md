# Common Pitfalls

## Pitfall 1: Technical Tasks Disguised as User Stories
**Symptom:** "As a developer, I want to refactor the API, so that the code is cleaner"

**Consequence:** This is an engineering task, not a user story. No user value is delivered.

**Fix:** If there's no user outcome, it's not a user story—use an engineering task or tech debt ticket instead.

---

## Pitfall 2: "As a User" (Too Generic)
**Symptom:** Every story starts with "As a user"

**Consequence:** No persona clarity. Different users have different needs.

**Fix:** Use specific personas: "As a trial user," "As a paid subscriber," "As an admin," etc. (reference `skills/proto-persona/SKILL.md`)

---

## Pitfall 3: "So That" Restates "I Want To"
**Symptom:** "I want to click the save button, so that I can save my work"

**Consequence:** No insight into *why* the user cares. Just restating the action.

**Fix:** Dig into the motivation: "so that I don't lose my progress if the page crashes" (real outcome).

---

## Pitfall 4: Multiple When/Then Statements
**Symptom:** Acceptance criteria with 5 "When" statements and 5 "Then" statements

**Consequence:** Story is too big. Likely multiple features bundled together.

**Fix:** Split the story using `skills/user-story-splitting/SKILL.md`. Each When/Then pair should be its own story (or at least evaluated for splitting).

---

## Pitfall 5: Untestable Acceptance Criteria
**Symptom:** "Then the user has a better experience" or "Then it's faster"

**Consequence:** QA can't verify success. Ambiguous definition of "done."

**Fix:** Make it measurable: "Then the page loads in under 2 seconds" or "Then the user sees a success confirmation message."
