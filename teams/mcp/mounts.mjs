// mounts.mjs - stage-mounted skills and MCP tools for the graph engine's own stages.
//
// taskmanager.mjs's STAGE_SKILLS pins method to the manager's own stages (shape, critique,
// accept, integrate, gate:goal) via tm_open({skills}). The graph engine that every size-S
// request actually runs had no counterpart at all: plan, critique, test, review and every
// gate ran on their contract alone. This is that mechanism, restored for the engine.
//
// It sits next to, not instead of, the two skills mechanisms graph.mjs and prompts.mjs
// already have:
//   - KINDS.skills (graph.mjs) picks method by what a subgoal IS (subgoal vs document).
//   - a spec's own sg.skills (setgoal) picks method by what a subgoal NEEDS.
// Both of those render inside composePrompt's `## Subgoal` block, only for a node that
// belongs to a subgoal chain. Stage-mounted skills are orthogonal: they pin method to the
// STAGE regardless of what kind of work is running through it or what the spec asked for,
// which is why plan, critique and gate:goal - none of which ever has a subgoal - get one
// here for the first time.
//
// MCP mounts are the same idea for tools rather than skills: a stage may be offered a
// specific MCP tool (sequential-thinking for plan, think-tool for setgoal, mcp-reasoner
// for the goal gate) to reason with. Advisory only - a tool that is not connected is
// skipped in silence, never searched for and never blocking.

import { nodeKind } from './graph.mjs';

// Shared by every Method block a composed prompt can carry - the per-subgoal one below and
// the stage-mounted one mounts.mjs renders - so the two mechanisms state the same rule in
// the same words instead of drifting apart.
// Telemetry, not method: without this field no graph node ever said which skills it loaded, so
// a run with no skills mounted at all was indistinguishable from one that used them.
