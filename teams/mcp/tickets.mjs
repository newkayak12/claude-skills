// row, the exact same string a QA-filed defect STORY's own reporter used to carry before this
// split (see FILED_ORIGINS below) - two different kinds of row, one token, no way to tell them
// apart. `reporter: 'planning'` for a phase-Team/repair/shape-declared package is honest instead
// of a phase name: this row exists because a role (roles.planning/roles.qa) is on, or shape
// itself, not because anyone filed anything - `origin` ('phase'/'repair'/'shape') carries which
// case it is, and the caller's own `role`/`phase` field already carries which phase. epicBoardRows

// for an upstream fix, `link: {type:'blocks', target:<upstream package id>}`) directly - nothing
// here recomputes them. An OLD task.json (written before this split existed) instead carries the
// single overloaded `reporter` this function used to return by itself - 'qa'/'you'/
// 'planning-audit'/'upstream' - and, for an upstream fix, never a `reported_by`/`upstream` field
// on the package itself (only task.unresolved_defects' own cap-exhausted fallback entries ever
// carried those - see fileUpstreamDefects) - so a legacy upstream-filed package's own filer can
